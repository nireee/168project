Introduction: 
	CuttleFight is a four player game that allows players to act as cuttlefish and trying to colored blocks using their inks. By clicking on the dice at the center of the board, cuttlefishes will move one by one. When stepping on white blocks, cuttlefish will spend 2% of ink to colored the block. When stepping on blocks that are colored by other cuttlefishes, this cuttlefish will spend 4% of ink to colored the block. When stepping on blocks with the same color of the cuttlefish, the cuttlefish will replenish 4% of ink. There are multiple special abilities displayed randomly on the map, cuttlefishes will get different buffs/debuffs when stepping on blocks with special ability. The buffs/debuffs will stay with the cuttlefish until it occurs with another special ability.
Win Condition:
	When any cuttlefish's ink value goes to 0, the game will automatically stops and count the remaining ink value of each cuttlefish. Cuttlefish with the largest ink value will become winner of this round.The result will display for 15 seconds and lead to the end scene.
